geeky pics for everyone. you can download high-resolutions images for non-commercial use only. In other words, you can use the pictures for making hand-out materials for conferences and meet-ups or decorating your walls at home or office, but you can't use the pictures for making money, i.e. put it on some objects and sell.

## t-shirts and posters with listed pictures are available from this [store](https://teespring.com/stores/pcs). puchasing something is the best way to support new pictures.
